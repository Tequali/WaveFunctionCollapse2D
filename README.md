# WaveFunctionCollapse2D

This was a school project i created in my 5th semester after being inspired by countless videos about that topic.

THe Wave Function Collapse or WFC for short allows to generate layouts for worlds based on an example made by the developer.
It checks how the example is build up, converts it into numbers, solves it like a puzzle and goes like a water ripple until there has been a solution.

Due to the problems of that algorithm it is not optimal for generating large layouts.
For example, I used simple images inside Unity Engine to create a small tileset that allows me to generate a large amount of small islands with relative ease thanks to the EFC algorithm.

This repository serves as a way to store that useful technique without losing it in case things go wrong.
